## Description

A command-line application that quickly and easily generates a professional README.md file for your project. This tool allows developers to devote more time to working on their projects by automating the creation of a high-quality README with all essential sections.

The application uses Node.js and the Inquirer package to prompt users for information about their repository, then dynamically generates a markdown file with a standardized structure including a title, description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage information, license details, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information.
